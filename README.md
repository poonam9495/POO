# Introduction of project:
Thyroid disease is very common problem in India.Many people suffering from it.
The main objective of this project is to predict if a person is having compensated hypothyroid, primary hypothyroid, secondary hypothyroid or negative (no thyroid) with the help of Machine Learning. Classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost and KNN Model have been trained on the thyroid dataset,After hyperparameter tuning XGBoost model has performed well with better accuracy, precision and recall. Application has deployed on Heroku with the help of flask framework.

# Techniques used:
Python 
Important Libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib & seaborn
Front-end: HTML, CSS
Back-end: Flask framework
IDE: Jupyter Notebook, Pycharm & VSCode
Database: Cassandra
Deployment: Heroku, AWS

# For run this app:
create virtual enviornment and activate it.
Install all the required packages by using requirements.txt file.

# Database:
For this project data collection and preprocessing is important steps. for that
we use cassandra database.
we are handling outliers and missing values.
we use KNN , randomforesr, ordinal encoding, standard scaler method etc.

# Model Creaton:
Model created by using XGBoost,KNN,Random Forest,RandomsearchCV etc.
model performance based on Accuracy,classification report.

# UI: This is the single user interface Prediction.
